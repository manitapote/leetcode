### Statistical Inference

#### Sampling
- Random Sampling
- Stratified sampling: Diving the population into categories.

#### Bias and chance error
estimate = parameter + bias + chance error
- chance error also called sampling error will get smaller as the sample size gets bigger.

When we repeat the sampling, chance error is different for different sample. But the bias is not
increased. Typically, we do    not know how large the bias is.

#### Randomized controlled experiments
- To find the causation, an experiment is required.
- The experiment should be double-blind. The subjects nor the evaluators know the assignments to treatment and control.


#### Module 3, Probability
- Subjective probability: This is not based on the experiment, different people assign different subjective probability
to same event.
- Mutually exclusive: The events A and B are called mutually exclusive if they can not occur at the same time.
- Addition rule: if A and B are mutually exclusive then P(A or B) = P(A) + p(B)
- Multiplication rule: If A and B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)
- P(B|A) = P(A|B)P(B)/(P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|not B)P(not B))
- **Warner Randomized Response Model**: It is a statistical technique used primarily in survey research to protect the
privacy of respondents while still allowing researchers to gather sensitive data. This method involves respondents randomly
deciding (based on a specified probability) whether to answer a sensitive question truthfully or to provide a predetermined
response. This randomness helps to maintain the confidentiality of individual responses, reducing the likelihood of respondents
lying about the stigmatized or illegal behavior, thereby increasing the accuracy of the survey results.
