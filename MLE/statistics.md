### Statistical Inference

#### Sampling
- Random Sampling
- Stratified sampling: Diving the population into categories.

#### Bias and chance error
estimate = parameter + bias + chance error
- chance error also called sampling error will get smaller as the sample size gets bigger.

When we repeat the sampling, chance error is different for different sample. But the bias is not
increased. Typically, we do not know how large the bias is.
