#### Linked List
Advantages of linked list:
- Adaptability of memory, they can grow or shrink in size as demand of application at runtime. There is no need to define the size ahead of time.
- Low overhead in insertion or deletion of nodes as it does not require shifting the elements as in array.
- No memory wastage as memory is allocated as needed.

Uses:
- Used in stacks and queues
- Ease of reversal


Drawbacks:
- Sequential Access: Direct access to a specific index is not as efficient as in arrays since it requires traversing the list from the beginning up to that index.
- Cannot go from right to left.
